Lightfoot is a 2D puzzle platformer where you trick a monster into aiding your escape. It was created by Jordan Smith and Julian Showen for their senior project at the University of Florida.

# Story
You are a spritely being currently pursued by a monstrous entity that responds only to light. In order to escape its lair, you must trick the monster into aiding your escape by using its fists as platforms or to press large buttons to open doors.

# Controls
Use the `A` and `D` keys to move left and right, the `W` and `Space` keys to jump, and the `S` key to crouch and fall through platforms.
Press the `E` key near levers to switch them on or off.
Pay close attention to the lamp's light meter in every level; if it becomes fully white, the monster will appear and start crashing his fists down on where you stand.
